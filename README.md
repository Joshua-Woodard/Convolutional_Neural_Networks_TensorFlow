# Convolutional Neural Networks TensorFlow
Jupyter Notebook created alongside course study of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with TensorFlow.

## What it covers:
* Binary Classification of images using CNN
  * Create model -> Compile -> Fit -> Evaluate -> Adjust hyperparameters
* Multiclass Classification of images using CNN
  * Create model -> Compile -> Fit -> Evaluate -> Adjust hyperparameters
* Data Augmentation to reduce overfitting
* Make predictions
* Save/Load Model
